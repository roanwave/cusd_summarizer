# CUSD Summarizer - Version 2 Fixes

## What's Fixed

### 1. Individual Email Summaries Now Show Up ‚úÖ
- Added better logging to track summary generation
- Improved JSON parsing with fallback handling
- Ensured 'summary' field always has content
- You'll now see actual 2-3 sentence summaries for each email

### 2. Stricter Grade-Specific Filtering ‚úÖ
- More explicit instructions to filter "1st Grade", "2nd Grade", etc.
- Better examples in the prompt
- Should now properly exclude:
  - ‚ùå "4th Grade Trip to Zoo"
  - ‚ùå "1st Grade Fire Safety Assembly"  
  - ‚ùå "3rd Grade Parent Night"
- While keeping:
  - ‚úÖ School Carnival
  - ‚úÖ Picture Day
  - ‚úÖ Earthquake Drill
  - ‚úÖ Kindergarten events

### 3. Wednesday Early Release Handling ‚úÖ
- Now explicitly instructs AI to mark as LOW priority
- Automatically adds: "Student attends ELC after school - no pickup change needed"
- Should appear as üü¢ LOW priority instead of üî¥ HIGH

## Installation

### Quick Replace

```powershell
# Backup current file
copy modules\ai_summarizer.py modules\ai_summarizer.py.backup

# Copy new version
copy ai_summarizer.py modules\
```

### Test It

```powershell
cd C:\Users\erick\py\cusd_summarizer
python main.py --force
```

## What to Look For

After running, check the Word document:

1. **Individual Email Summaries section** (bottom)
   - Should show actual 2-3 sentence summaries
   - NOT "No summary available"

2. **Events list**
   - ‚ùå No "4th Grade Trip to Zoo"
   - ‚ùå No "1st Grade Fire Safety Assembly"
   - ‚úÖ School-wide events included

3. **Wednesday Early Release**
   - Should be LOW priority (üü¢ green circle)
   - Should say "Student attends ELC, no pickup change"

## Debug Info

This version adds better logging. If something's wrong, check:

```powershell
type logs\cusd_summarizer.log
```

Look for lines like:
```
Successfully summarized email xxx: summary=150 chars, events=2, actions=1
```

This tells you if summaries are being generated.

## If Issues Persist

If individual summaries still don't show:
1. The problem might be in document_generator.py (not AI)
2. Let me know and I'll fix that module next

If grade filtering still isn't working:
1. Check the logs for "filtered_content" field
2. The AI might need even more explicit instructions
